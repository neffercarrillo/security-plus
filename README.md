# Notes on CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) 

These are the notes I took while following Jason Dion's Security+ training on Udemy. 

Not all of the concepts in the course were included. Some topics were summarized and others were not included at all. 

Use these notes as a reference of the concepts covered in the exam.
